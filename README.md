# Trying adopt and practice python best practices
## 1.Concerns Separation
this is where we try create function and classes that are supposed one function while itergrating with others classes or function that do other functions to create a complete app

## 2. Extensiblity and flexibility
This is where we create software/application that can be easily extended, for instance, adding new feature to an existing appliation. creaing flexible applications that can change or adapt to shifting requirement.

## 2.Inheritance
This is where classes inherit behavoir of other classes. 
Here we are trying to use inheritance to abstract functions of a class using ABC and abstractmethods
