# Trying adopt and practice python best practices
## 1.Concerns Separation
this is where we try create function and classes that are supposed one function while itergrating with others classes or function that do other functions to create a complete app

## 2.Flexibilty and Extensibilty
This we write programs that can be easily extend and can be changed with ease. Where when those changes are made they don't affect the other parts of the program.

## 3.Inheritance
This is where classes inherit behavoir of other classes. 
Here we are trying to use inheritance to abstract functions of a class using ABC and abstractmethods
